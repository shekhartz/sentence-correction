# Sentence Correction using Attention-based Sequence-to-Sequence Model

This project aims to create a preprocessing method for converting raw text containing possible errors or wild characters/internet acronyms/texting abbreviations/messaging shorthands to standard English format clean text. Our system objective is to convert the corrupted input sentence to target sentence with the goal of the output being to preserve the latent properties of the input text (sentiment, named entities, etc.) but mutated in a way that embeds these properties in a representation familiar to other Natural Language Processing systems.
